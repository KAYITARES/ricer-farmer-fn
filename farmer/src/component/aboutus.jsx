          Rice is a priority food crop in Rwanda. With an average productivity
          of 5.8 t /Ha, rice is grown over 12,400 Ha of marshlands in two
          seasons which makes around 80,000 MT per year. Although there has been
          a rapid rise in rice production in the past decade, the country has
          not yet achieved self-sufficiency. Rwanda annually imports an average
          of 26,736 t of milled rice. Furthermore, the quality of locally
          produced rice lags behind that of imported rice. Thus Rwandaâ€™s rice
          sector is confronted with how to sustainably raise both the production
          and quality of locally grown rice to meet the consumer demands.
