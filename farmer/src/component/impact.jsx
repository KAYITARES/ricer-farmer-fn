    <h5>Rwangingo Rice Farmer Impact</h5>
        <div/>
     
       <div className="grt">
<p><center>Farmers and livestock keepers in parts of Rwandaâ€™s Eastern Province
   suffer from periodic and unpredictable times when rain does not fall, and a significant annual dry season in July and August. In response, the Government of Rwanda was financially supported by the World Bank to construct a US$10 million dam retaining a 95-hectares water reservoir with a capacity of 3.3 million cubic metres and irrigation channels to distribute water to over 875 hectares of farmland. It was completed in 2015, but there was no plan on how to organize water users
   to sustainably exploit this infrastructure, until CDAIS came in to fill the gap.</center></p>
